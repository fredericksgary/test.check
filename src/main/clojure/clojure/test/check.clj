  "Shrinking a value produces a sequence of smaller values of the same type.

  modified depth-first search of the tree:

  Do a non-exhaustive search for a deeper (than the root) failing example.
  Additional rules added to depth-first search:
  * If a node passes the property, you may continue searching at this depth,
  but not backtrack
  * If a node fails the property, search its children
  The value returned is the left-most failing example at the depth where a
  passing example was found."
