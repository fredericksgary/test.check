  "Tests `property` `num-tests` times.

  Takes several optional keys:

  `:seed`
    Can be used to re-run previous tests, as the seed used is returned
    after a test is run.

  `:max-size`.
    can be used to control the 'size' of generated values. The size will
    start at 0, and grow up to max-size, as the number of tests increases.
    Generators will use the size parameter to bound their growth. This
    prevents, for example, generating a five-thousand element vector on
    the very first test.

  `:reporter-fn`
    A callback function that will be called at various points in the test
    run, with a map like:

      ;; called after a passing trial
      {:type      :trial
       :property  #<...>
       :so-far    <number of tests run so far>
       :num-tests <total number of tests>}

      ;; called after each failing trial
      {:type         :failure
       :property     #<...>
       :result       ...
       :trial-number <tests ran before failure found>
       :failing-args [...]}

    It will also be called on :complete, :shrink-step and :shrunk.

  Examples:

      (def p (for-all [a gen/pos-int] (> (* a a) a)))

      (quick-check 100 p)
